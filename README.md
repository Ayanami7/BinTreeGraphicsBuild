# Visual Binary Tree

Based on the Qt6.3.2 on X64/win32 platform  
This program is based on Qt FrameWork to achieve the binary tree visual construction and traversal,
and it's originally to apply for SAU DS Design work  
I refer to the visual design of this project [VisualTree](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1v8411t71T)

This program is not yet finished,I haven't finished all functions
